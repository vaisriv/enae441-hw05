For each k ∈ {10, 50, 200}, the histograms show the distribution of the
batch least-squares state estimates across the 50 trials.

As k increases, the histograms for ẑ₀ become narrower and more tightly
clustered around a common mean. The sample variances of ẑ₀ decrease
and approach the corresponding diagonal entries of the analytical
covariance Pₖ = (Γₖᵀ R⁻¹ Γₖ)⁻¹, which is expected for a linear
unbiased least-squares estimator driven by independent Gaussian noise.

The estimates of ż̂₀ are centered close to zero (since the spacecraft
is effectively stationary in the chosen frame), and their spread also
shrinks with increasing k, reflecting the fact that longer time spans
give more leverage to estimate the slope in the constant-velocity model.
