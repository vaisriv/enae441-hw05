The pure prediction curves (μₖ⁻, Pₖ⁻) show the state evolution and
uncertainty when only the process model and process noise are applied.
Between measurements, the covariance Pₖ⁻ grows due to injected
process noise Q at each step, reflecting increasing uncertainty about
the spacecraft's position and velocity in the absence of new data.

The measurement-updated curves (μₖ⁺, Pₖ⁺) show the effect of
incorporating the noisy position measurements. At each update, the
position components' covariance drops sharply relative to Pₖ⁻, often
to values significantly below the measurement noise variance, because
the filter fuses multiple measurements over time.

Thus:
- Pₖ⁻ typically increases between updates (model + process noise).
- Pₖ⁺ is always less than or equal to Pₖ⁻ after each measurement.
- μₖ⁺ tends to track the true trajectory more closely than μₖ⁻,
  which drifts when the model is driven only by process noise.
