The residuals δyₖ = yₖ - H xₖ⁺ represent the difference between the
actual measurements and the measurement predicted by the updated state.

For a well-tuned linear Kalman filter with correctly modeled process and
measurement noise, these residuals should be approximately zero-mean,
uncorrelated in time, and have a variance somewhat smaller than the
raw measurement noise variance (because the filter has already used
each measurement to refine the state estimate).

In this problem, the nominal measurement noise standard deviation is
σₘₑₐₛ ≈ 31.62 [km], so a ±3σ band is about ±94.87 [km].
Thus, most residuals should lie within this range, and there should be no
obvious deterministic trend over time. Any strong bias or systematic
trend in the residuals would suggest either a modeling error or a mismatch
between the assumed initial state/covariance and the actual conditions.
